# turtle_crossing_game


Description:-

This is a simple Python game called Turtle Crossing.
The player controls a turtle character using the arrow keys and tries to cross a busy road without getting hit by passing cars.
The game gets progressively harder as the player successfully crosses the road.


Files:-

main.py: Contains the main game loop and initializes the game.
car_manager.py: Manages the cars' behavior, including their movement.
scoreboard.py: Manages the game's scoreboard, displaying the player's level.
player.py: Defines the attributes and behavior of the player-controlled turtle character.


How to Play:-

Run main.py using Python (python main.py).
Use the arrow keys (up, down) to move the turtle character.
Avoid getting hit by cars while crossing the road.
Each successful crossing earns an increase in level, and the game gets more challenging.
